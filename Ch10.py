# At one college, the tuition for a full-time student is $8, 000 per semester. It has been announced that the tuition will increase by 3 percent each year for the next 5 years. Write a program with a loop that displays the projected semester tuition amount for the next 5 years.

# Write a program that calculates the amount of money a person would earn over a period of time if his or her salary is one penny the first day, two pennies the second day, and continues to double each day.

The output should be displayed in a dollar amount, not the number of pennies
